Installing Greenbone Security Assistant

The reference system used by the developers is Debian GNU Linux 'Lenny' 5.0.
The build might fail on any other systems.  Also it is necessary to install
dependent development packages.

Prerequisites:
* openvas-libraries 4.0.0 or greater
* gnutls
* cmake
* glib-2.0 (>= 2.14)
* libxml
* libxslt
* libmicrohttpd
* libexslt
* pkg-config

Prerequisites for building documentation:
* Doxygen
* xmltoman (optional, for building man page)

If you have installed required libraries to a non-standard location, remember to
set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the location of you pkg-config
files before configuring:

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/your/location/lib/pkgconfig

Then configure the build with

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation .

or (if you want to use the default installation path /usr/local)

    $ cmake .

This only needs to be done once.  Note: It is assumed that the other OpenVAS
components are installed to the same path.  If not, you need to set some paths
separately, see below for details.

Thereafter, the following commands are useful.

    $ make                # build the Greenbone Security Assistant
    $ make doc            # build the documentation
    $ make install        # install the build
    $ make rebuild_cache  # rebuild the make system cache


In case you have installed the Greenbone Security Assistant into a path
different from the other OpenVAS modules, you might need to set some paths
explicitly before running cmake. The variables OPENVAS_LIB_INSTALL_DIR and
OPENVAS_HEADER_INSTALL_DIR in the "Variables" section of the top level
CMakeLists.txt can be edited to link to a custom installation of OpenVAS. The
certificate and key locations in OPENVAS_SERVER_CERTIFICATE, OPENVAS_SERVER_KEY
and OPENVAS_CA_CERTIFICATE may also need modifying.

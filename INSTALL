INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR GREENBONE SECURITY ASSISTANT
==========================================================

Please note: The reference system used by most of the developers is Debian
GNU/Linux 'Squeeze' 6.0. The build might fail on any other system. Also it is
necessary to install dependent development packages.


Prerequisites for Greenbone Security Assistant
----------------------------------------------

See at the end of this section how to easily install these prerequisites on
some supported platforms.

Prerequisites:
* openvas-libraries (>= 7.0.0)
* gnutls (>= 2.8)
* cmake
* glib-2.0 (>= 2.16)
* libxml
* libxslt
* libmicrohttpd (>= 0.4.2)
* libexslt
* pkg-config
* xsltproc

Prerequisites for building documentation:
* Doxygen
* xmltoman (optional, for building man page)

Install prerequisites on Debian GNU/Linux 'Squeeze' 6.0:
# apt-get install libmicrohttpd-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

Compiling Greenbone Security Assistant
--------------------------------------

If you have installed required libraries to a non-standard location, remember to
set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the location of you pkg-config
files before configuring:

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/your/location/lib/pkgconfig

Create a build directory and change into it with

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

Then configure the build with

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation ..

or (if you want to use the default installation path /usr/local)

    $ cmake ..

This only needs to be done once.  Note: It is assumed that the other OpenVAS
components are installed to the same path.  If not, you need to set some paths
separately, see below for details.

Thereafter, the following commands are useful.

    $ make                # build the Greenbone Security Assistant
    $ make doc            # build the documentation
    $ make doc-full       # build more developer-oriented documentation
    $ make install        # install the build
    $ make rebuild_cache  # rebuild the cmake cache


In case you have installed the Greenbone Security Assistant into a path
different from the other OpenVAS modules, you might need to set some paths
explicitly before running cmake. The certificate and key locations in
OPENVAS_SERVER_CERTIFICATE, OPENVAS_SERVER_KEY and OPENVAS_CA_CERTIFICATE in
the top level CMakeLists.txt may need modifying.
